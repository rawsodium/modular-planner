# modular-planner

A customizable web app to put all of your planning needs in one place.

I use a lot of different calendar apps and planners, but I feel like I've spread myself thin with where I put what. So I wanted to create something where I could centralize my calendar events, to-dos, random notes, and other things (like a more structured way for me to practice guitar). 

The name comes from the idea that I want to make this extremely customizable, with various different kinds of 'generic' cards that you can bring in and rearrange to fit your liking. You can add and delete sections of the app at your leisure. 

# Planned tools:
- Vue for the frontend
- Node for the backend.
- Connection to various APIs (of my choosing):
    - Google Calendar API
    - MBTA API
- MongoDB for the database, with connection to ElasticSearch for data syncing.
- maybe I'll try Dockerizing this?

Not an exhaustive list of technologies, but things I hope to make use of here.
